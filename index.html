                    <p> <strong> bulb is our needs </strong>Have you ever imagined how homes were illuminated? How would people live without electricity? How were electric lamps invented? In 1878, Thomas Alva Edison began research into developing a practical incandescent lamp, and in 1879, the Electronic bulb was invented. Edison applied for a patent for “Improvement in Electric Lights” on 14 October 1878.</p>

                <h3 >What is Bulb?</h3><hr>
                <p>The bulb is the simplest lamp that was invented for illumination more than a century ago. It was the small and simplest light that brightened the dark space. The bulb is also known as an incandescent lamp, incandescent light globe or incandescent light bulb. Bulb comes in different sizes and light output and operates with a voltage range from 1.5 Volts to about 300 Volts. Now let us study the parts and structure of the bulb in detail.</p>
